# Twinity - A Twine Parser
Ever thought of creating your own text adventure? [Twine](https://twinery.org), originally created by Chris Klimas, lets you create non-linear, interactive storytelling, that you can distribute as an HTML page.

But what if you want to create a narrative game in Unity?

Using Lazerwalker’s [Twison](https://github.com/lazerwalker) tool, you can create your interactive story in Twine, export it to JSON via Twison, and now import it into Unity with Twinity.

Makes use of Unify Community’s [Singleton](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Singleton) and [SimpleJSON](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON)

Includes an example Twine exported with Twison into JSON.
